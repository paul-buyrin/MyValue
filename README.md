# MyValue
Helps the user check the bookmaker's under/over soccer line odds against the Team's statistics.

"My value" label, displays in green whether there is an edge to play the over (2,5 goals) or in red if the edge is on under.

The larger the number, the more the odds diverge from the statistics, thus, the bigger the edge.
